# Detection of Anxiety Levels in Patients with Arachnophobia Through Biosignals

## Motivation

Soren Kierkegaard's "The Concept of Anxiety" laid the groundwork for understanding anxiety in the 19th century. Initially viewed as a positive impulse towards ethical choices, anxiety is now recognized as a natural response to stress. However, excessive and prolonged anxiety can lead to disorders, prevalent in Portugal and worldwide. Arachnophobia, an irrational fear of spiders, is one such anxiety disorder. Symptoms include increased heart rate, sweating, trembling, and difficulty breathing. Treatment often involves exposure therapy, gradually exposing patients to feared objects. Our study focuses on monitoring anxiety levels during exposure therapy sessions for arachnophobia patients, using biosignals like ECG, GSR, and BR.
